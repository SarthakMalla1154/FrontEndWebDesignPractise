### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While I explored this challenge, I was introduced to the concept of CSS Grids. I am still unknown of its full capacity and how it works, but I was able to use it in my code.

```css
.grid-container{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
    padding: 0 0 0 7%;
}
```

### Continued development

Although I was able to replicate the expected result closely, I am still lacking on how I can change the color of the image. I tried my best on making it the same color, but not sure how I can do it.

I was also unable to replicate the result in the mobile version. Not sure how to do it, yet.

### Useful resources

- [Changing Color of an Image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7415872/change-color-of-png-image-via-css) - This helped me in changing the color of the image. Although not exactly, it was pretty close.
- [Positioning Elements](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/positioning) - This is an amazing article which helped me grasp the ideas of positioning element, especially Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
